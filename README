This is a fork of NetBSD's netpgp project, which can be found in the NetBSD
CVS repository.

This fork differs from the original as follows:

- removed JSON functions
- added support for new-style indeterminate length packets (which means
  multi-recipient encrypted files generated by gnupg can now be decrypted)
